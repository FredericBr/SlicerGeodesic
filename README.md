# GeodesicSlicer
This module calculates geodesic path in 3D structure. Thanks to this geodesic path, this module can draw an EEG 10-20 system, determine the projected scalp stimulation site (MRI guided brain stimulation without the use of a neuronavigation System) and correct the rTMS resting motor threshold by correction factor. 

### Dependencies
